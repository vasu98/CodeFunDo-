Prediction and Management of a natural disaster
A variety of natural calamities occur every year in different parts of the world , taking a million lives. Predicting a natural disaster is a topic that is being researched on for years . When it comes to the management after a calamity, we still use manual methods which aren’t  efficient. Here , we propose a soluton for prediction as well as managing the after effects of an Earthquake.

Earthquake can generate electromagnetic (EM) waves because of the electrokinetic effect.These generated EM waves arrive at a distant observatory much earlier than the seismic waves because their velocities are much faster than those of the seismic waves. Taking advantage of this fact, we believe that we can predict an Earthquake by training a system using the following attributes:
Electromagnetic Waves
Magnitude
Magnitude Type
Magnitude Seismic Stations
Location Source

Even after prediction, the damage occurred has a very little chance of getting minimized. Here comes the step of managing the calamities after effects. Loss of cconnection,which is a vital part of our lives is a direct consequence of an earthquake. After the disaster , finding out the people who are stuck somewhere becomes a humungous task. Mobile towers may get destroyed because of which there's an absense of communication among the public. It becomes difficult for a person in that situation to contact their neighbors or call for help. Such a situation calls for a fast operation of the disaster relief team that carries out this mission on a helicopter to trace the human beings to be rescued.  A lot of times, the information required to help the one in need is unavailable due to which proper course of action is not taken and  leads to loss of lives.

The fundamental problem here is the lack of network among the poeple. That is mostly because connection today is dependent on internet and mobile networks, because of which, the presence of a working device will not matter if the services go offline at the hour of need.

We believe that if technology can be used to provide a network to the people in such a situation, it will be extremely helpful in reducing the impact of the natural disaster. People nearby can help each other and the rescue team can locate people in need in a much more efficient way.

Hence, we propose a peer-to-peer network of devices using wifi-direct as a solution to this problem.Anyone having a device with wifi technology can easily connect to a network in that region and communicate with others.A ‘peer to peer’ system can be implemented here. This system will be able to broadcast messages from the rescue team to thode who are affected.Not only will it provide him/her vital information regarding survival but also keeps them mentally and emotionally stable during that time.
